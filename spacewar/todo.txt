The focus for the test is the following:

- I would like to see how you structure your code and what design and architectural decisions you make.
- This is a  gameplay test so the  "game" part of the assignment (is it fun, does it feel and play well) will be important. You are encouraged to be creative. 
- We expect a "finished" game, including UI, game states, scoring or anything else that fits your vision.
- 2D is perfectly fine

Requirements:

- Written in C++
- Be sure it compiles and works out of the box in Visual Studio 2017. I advise you to try out your zip on a separate machine first, before sending it to us, to ensure all dependencies are included.
- Feel free to use graphics libraries. 
- You have one week to finish this. Extensions are possible upon request.
