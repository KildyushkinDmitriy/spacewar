The focus for the test is the following:

- I would like to see how you structure your code and what design and architectural decisions you make.
- This is a  gameplay test so the  "game" part of the assignment (is it fun, does it feel and play well) will be important. You are encouraged to be creative. 
- We expect a "finished" game, including UI, game states, scoring or anything else that fits your vision.
- 2D is perfectly fine

Requirements:

- Written in C++
- Be sure it compiles and works out of the box in Visual Studio 2017. I advise you to try out your zip on a separate machine first, before sending it to us, to ensure all dependencies are included.
- Feel free to use graphics libraries. 
- You have one week to finish this. Extensions are possible upon request.

TODO:

- core
  - acceleration impulse?
  - scoring + ui game state (score screen, restart screen)
  - config file with gameplay stats? hot-reloadable?
  - tweak gameplay stats for fun
  - start game screen with controls help

- additional?
  - visualize thrusting
  - AI
  - visualize gravity force?
  - particles
  - sounds
  
- bugs/improvements
  - projectile/ship collision when ship is wrapped around world size
  - ship/ship continuous collision
